# Connectivity Study

## Overview

Connectivity experiments (linear and curved paths between modes) are summarized via barrier-height annotated plots saved under `reports/figures/.../connectivity/` for each (dataset, architecture, activation, optimizer, seed-pair) combination.

Refer to these figures alongside the depth, width, activation, and optimizer studies to interpret how easily different configurations can be connected in parameter space without encountering high-loss barriers.
